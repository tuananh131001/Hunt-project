Here is the ERD of my work:   
For the backend I created these above models with relationships that follow the requirements  
first then create controllers and services for each . Then I create the front end using React JS    
and React Router , React Query , for the back end I use redis , spring boot 2.7.7, kafka, java 17 
. I use monolithic architecture because it is easy to deploy and light.I have a complete search,  
filter,pagination,CRUD, edit,delete,... Product list,Bill of Material ,kafka ,deploy on cloud ,redis    
.,few MO , MPO, Inventory . I have not completed User management,   
authentication/authorization.   
max to explain clearly your approach, justify architecture and design you have chosen, what   
functionalities you have completed, what you have not completed, any innovation in your   
design.
